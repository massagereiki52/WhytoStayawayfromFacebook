<p>Have you ever thought to yourself, "Man, I wonder what so and so is eating, or I wonder what they are doing?"
  Now you can find out! We all have that friend who doesn't really have much to say but loves to share what they have eaten,
or who shares all of their drama on Facebook. Drama and Facebook, Whaaat?!!! I know it's hard to believe but drama is very
prevelant on Facebook. With Facebook, we can air all of our dirty laundry with no care of who reads it. What's with all of the emoji's, and
code words like LOL and TTYL? What does that mean? Maybe it's my age, but why can't we just use regular words anymore?
Like, laugh out loud and talk to you later? This Facebook thing I just don't get it.  </p>
